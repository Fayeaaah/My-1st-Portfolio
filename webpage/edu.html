         <p>Hi! I'm Kezia Faye Lumanog, I am 22 years old and I love traveling,
           <br>because when I was a child my dad will always bring me to different places.

           <br> When I am bored I edit video and pictures to practice my skills.
           <br> When editing videos and pictures I always used mobile editor,
           <br> because it is easy to use and very handy
